# Laboratory work Nr.1

## Student life management system within UTM.

The aim of this project is to develop a complex application that addresses several aspects of university and student life. Its main objective is to facilitate integration into the university environment, to provide support in maintaining a physical and mental well-being and to provide resources for the academic and professional development of students.

### Service Boundaries

 - Fitness data service
    - Integration with Xiaomi Mi Fitness devices to collect data on users' physical activity and health.
    - Create a scoring system and weekly summary to assess users' health and wellness progress.

- Integration with moodle
    - Implement a notification system to inform users about upcoming labs and exams.
    - Creating an absence monitoring system that calculates their estimated costs on academic performance.
    - Providing useful information about university resources, internship opportunities and information about alumni and personal mentors.

- Mentor for study
    - Development of an interface for learning and testing with flashcards, including the ability to customize and edit them.
    - Implementation of a voice recognition and text-to-speech conversion mode to facilitate users' access to learning content while on the go.
    - Creating two modes for learning cards: learning mode and test mode.
    - Integration with GPT Chat to provide additional support and answers to various questions.
    - Developing a user-friendly interface for desktop, iOS and Android.
    - Implementation of a voice recognition system and voice commands for all components of the application.



### Application Suitability

The application has multiple components, like fitness tracking, university management, and personal mentoring. These components can potentially be developed and maintained independently, making it suitable for a microservices architecture. Each module can have its own team responsible for development and updates.

### Scalability

Even though we arenâ€™t expecting a lot of users, since we are pitching this as an application for UTM students only, as of now, in theory, this application has the capability to scale to more universities in even more countries, which means a large user base, microservices can help with scalability, making it easy to scale individual services based on demand. For instance, the fitness and wellness module might experience different usage patterns compared to the university assistant module.

### Resilience

Since our application is modular, if one service fails, it won't necessarily bring down the entire application. Users can still access other functionalities.

### Third-party Integrations

Our application needs to integrate with various third-party services and APIs (e.g., Mi Fitness, calendar services, speech-to text and text to speech services,chat gpt,etc). Microservices can make it easier to manage these integrations separately.

### Real Life examples

Our applications is pretty similar to Coursera, LinkedIn, Duolingo, MiFitness, which are similar in such matters as notifications, scheduling, progress tracking, and personalized learning. They serve as valuable examples of how technology can enhance the educational and wellness aspects of students' lives. We take inspiration from these platforms while adding a unique combination of features.

### Set Up Deployment and Scaling

Azure pipelines, and Docker.
Azure Pipelines enables you to set up a CI/CD pipeline for Dockerized application. This means that whenever changes are pushed to code repository, Azure Pipelines can automatically build new Docker images, run tests, and deploy the updated containers to target environment, ensuring a rapid and reliable release process.

Docker simplifies the deployment process. You can create a Docker image once and deploy it to multiple environments without worrying about differences in the underlying infrastructure. Azure Pipelines automates the deployment process.

## Design Data Management

### User authentication:

- JSON Request to Register a New User:
```sh
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "secure_password123"
}
```

- JSON Response for User Registration:
```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
```

- JSON Request to Authenticate a User (Login):
```sh
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "secure_password123"
}
```

- JSON Response for User Authentication (Login):
```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User authenticated successfully",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Fitness Tracking Module:

- JSON Request to Log a Workout:
```sh
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "activity": "Running",
  "distance_km": 5.0,
  "duration_minutes": 30,
  "date": "2023-09-27"
}
```

- JSON Response for Workout Logging:
```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Workout logged successfully",
  "workout_id": "67890"
}
```

### University Management Module:

 - JSON Request to Enroll in a Course:
```sh
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "course_id": "CS101",
  "semester": "Fall 2023"
}
```

- JSON Response for Course Enrollment:
```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Enrolled in CS101 for Fall 2023"
}
```

### Personal Mentoring Module:

- JSON Request to Schedule a Mentorship Session:
```sh
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "mentor_id": "67890",
  "session_datetime": "2023-10-05T15:00:00",
  "topic": "Career Guidance"
}
```

- JSON Response for Mentorship Session Scheduling:
```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Mentorship session scheduled for 2023-10-05 at 3:00 PM"
}
```

### Notifications Module (using RabbitMQ):

- JSON Request to Send a Notification:

```sh
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "message": "Don't forget your upcoming workout session tomorrow at 8:00 AM."
}
```

- JSON Response for Notification Request:
 ```sh
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Notification sent successfully"
}
```

```sh
syntax = "proto3";

message FitnessActivityNotification {
  string user_id = 1;
  string activity_id = 2;
  string message = 3;
  repeated string channels = 4;
}

message NotificationResponse {
  bool success = 1;
  string message = 2;
}

service NotificationService {
  rpc SendFitnessActivityNotification(FitnessActivityNotification) returns (NotificationResponse);
}
```
